    Download both 32bit and 64bit Ubuntu ISOs. (Tested with Ubuntu 15.10)

    Download a multi-arch Debian ISO. (Tested with Debian 8.2.0 netinst ISO)

    Format your USB disk as FAT and mount it
        In Gnome Disks, select the USB drive in the left list, go to the "Hamburger Menu" in the upper-right corner, choose Format Disk, select MSR/DOS partitioning, and Format. Then click '+' and accept defaults which should create a FAT partition. Finally, click the "play" triangle to mount it.
    Extract installation files from the Ubuntu 32-bit ISO while copying the contents of the symlinks
        In Gnome Disks, open the Disks menu (up where File and Edit normally are), choose Attach Disk Image, select ubuntu-15.10-desktop-i386.iso, and mount the biggest partition.
        In Terminal, rsync -rL --exclude=/ubuntu <path to Ubuntu 32-bit install disk>/ <path to usb disk>/
            Replace <placeholders> with the correct paths
            Don't forget the slash at the end of the source path
    Copy /boot and /EFI directories from an Ubuntu 64-bit ISO
        Mount the iso
        rsync -r <path to Ubuntu 64-bit install disk>/boot/ <path to usb disk>/boot/
        rsync -r <path to Ubuntu 64-bit install disk>/EFI/ <path to usb disk>/EFI/
            Again, the slashes at the end are significant
    Copy 32-bit GRUB from a Debian multi-arch ISO
        Mount the iso
        cp <path to Debian multi-arch install disk>/efi/boot/bootia32.efi <path to usb disk>/EFI/BOOT/
        rsync -r <path to Debian multi-arch install disk>/boot/grub/i386-efi <path to usb disk>/boot/grub/
            Watch those slashes (this time the source doesn't end in a slash)
    Rename vmlinuz to vmlinuz.efi
        mv <path to usb disk>/casper/vmlinuz <path to usb disk>/casper/vmlinuz.efi
    Unmount everything
    Disable Secure Boot on target system and boot from the USB drive.
    Install Ubuntu! (I've tested with "Erase disk and encrypt it with LVM" option and the install works automatically--unless the kernel doesn't support the flash chips in the device.)
    System should be "ready." It will boot, but actually it may not be very functional due to lack of drivers (as of Ubuntu 16.04). Check out this Google+ group for more advice and latest patched kernels.
