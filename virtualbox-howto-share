2. Highlight the Vista VM entry (make sure that it is in Powered off state) and click on the Settings icon at the top.
3. On the left, click on the Network. On the right, make sure that the Enable Network Adaptor and Cable Connected are checked.
4. On the left, click on the Shared Folders. Then, click on the 'virtualbox add share folder' icon on the far right.
5. Select the folder that you want to use as a share point. Give it a name. For example: folder path:/home/damien/share, folder name: share
6. Click OK to close the Settings window.
7. Boot up your Vista VM.
8. Install the guest addition. (Skip this step if you have already done so). Devices, Install Guest Additions.
9. Restart the Vista VM
10. Open your Windows Explorer, click on the Map Network Drive
11. In the Folder input text, enter: '\\vboxsvr\sharename'. where sharename is the name of the share folder that you add just now. Make sure that the Reconnect at logon is checked.
12. Click Finish

You should now see the shared folder mounted as a network drive. Thatâ€™s it.
