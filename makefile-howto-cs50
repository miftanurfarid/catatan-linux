thout a makefile, Make takes its cues from environment variables set in your shell (specifically, those loaded in /etc/profile.d/appliance50.sh).

To get the same behavior from Make as it has in the CS50 Appliance, you can add the following to your .bashrc (or .zshrc, etc, if you're using a different shell):

export CC=clang  
export CFLAGS="-ggdb3 -O0 -std=c99 -Wall -Werror"
export LDLIBS="-lcs50 -lm"

(Note that we're using clang, not gcc, in CS50.)
